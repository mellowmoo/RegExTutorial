# Reg Ex Tutorial

Reg Ex stands for regular expression.  Regular expression is a way to search through a string of text.  We can use this functionality to do things such as validation and replace text, among many other things.

## Summary

Briefly summarize the regex you will be describing and what you will explain. Include a code snippet of the regex. Replace this text with your summary.  In general; it allows us to search through text in an advanced way. Here is an example of regular expression below.

/ MellowMoo /g

We first start of the reg ex with a forward slash ( / ).  We also close it with one.  Inside the forward slashes is the string that we are searching for.  Outside of the closing forward slash is a single letter.  This is an expression tag.  The most common expression tags are g (global), i(case insensitive), s (single line (dotal)), u (unicode), y (sticky).  The definition of these tags is below.

global - Without the global tag, the search will only find the first term that matches the  reg ex provided.  With the global tag, the search will show you all the matching terms in the document.

case insensitive -
